## Exectuable

Precompiled binaries for Windows will be linked here:

[GitHub Release Page](http://github.com/EdmundOwen/QuMESHS/releases)

The deal.II executables used to calculate the potentials 
are not configured to run under Windows.  These binaries 
will only solve the 1D problem or FlexPDE must be 
available.

To use the deal.II executables, QuMESHS must be run 
under Linux.  We recommend compiling the deal.II
libraries on your own computer.  In order to run the 
executables in Linux, the executables must be bundled 
using mono (details to come shortly).
