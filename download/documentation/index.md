#Documentation

Documentation for QuMESHS is under development.  A partially complete 
user guide is available as a .tex file here:

[QuMESHS User Guide](https://github.com/EdmundOwen/QuMESHS/tree/user_guide)

The guide includes descriptions of most inputs and outputs along with 
some theory and a basic description of the layout of the code.

A most recent pdf version can be found with the zipped release on
[GitHub](https://github.com/EdmundOwen/QuMESHS/releases).
