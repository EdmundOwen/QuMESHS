# Things to do

Many intended features of QuMESHS are still in development.  These include:

## Major features

* Currently, the ability of the software to model more complex systems is not very well tested.
* Extension of the software to 3D calculations are in progress.
* Not all materials and geometries have been tested.
* Calculate transmission coefficients from Green's function calculations
* Remove dependence on proprietary NMath library to allow compilation by all
* Generalize device structures for FlexPDE
* Generalize device structures for deal.II

## Minor features

* Add example deal.II programs to the website

## Bug Fixes

* No current bugs documented

If you encounter additional bugs, please email them to [Edmund Owen](eto24@cam.ac.uk)
