# Development

QuMESHS is a community project and we encourage others to participate in its development.  If you want to contribute to the QuMESHS project feel free to download the source code from GitHub.  Please note that you will need an NMath license in order to compile the code.

If you want to contribute, then we would be very interested in getting to know you.  Please email [Edmund Owen](eto24@cam.ac.uk) if you want to get in touch.  Some additional features to get started on, which we plan on doing ourselves, can be found on the ``Things to do'' page.
