# About Us

QuMESHS was designed to model electrons (and potentially holes) in 
semiconductor heterostructures.  The original focus was to study 
quasi-one-dimensional constrictions, with a specific focus on the 
low density limit, but the software has been designed to be 
applicable to more general semiconductor heterostructure systems.

QuMESHS can simulate 1, 2 and 3-D electron systems in layered 
semiconductor heterostructures.

QuMESHS was developed by Edmund Owen and Crispin Barnes with 
additional contributions by Thomas Gemunden.  This work was
developed under the EPSRC grant `Nanoelectronic Based Quantum
Physics - Technology and Applications` under the direction of
Mike Pepper and supported by the Engineering and Physical 
Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK, EP/K004077/1.
